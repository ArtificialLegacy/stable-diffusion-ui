Congrats on downloading Stable Diffusion UI, version 2!

Please double-click the "Start Stable Diffusion UI.cmd" file inside the "stable-diffusion-ui" folder.

That file will automatically install everything. After that it will start the Stable Diffusion interface in a web browser.

To start the UI in the future, please run the same "Start Stable Diffusion UI.cmd" file.
